This documentation describes how to install, configure, and use Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for PCF registers a service broker on PCF and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace.
Developers can provision Hazelcast clusters by creating instances of the service plans using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for PCF uses an on-demand services SDK, which is a part of [Pivotal Cloud Services SDK](https://network.pivotal.io/products/on-demand-services-sdk),
to fully utilize BOSH-2.0 features and let you provision instances more flexibly.

Features of Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for PCF include the following:

* Based on [Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise](https://hazelcast.com/), the leading in-memory data grid (IMDG)
* The ability to dynamically pass your Hazelcast configuration in JSON format when creating services
* An on-demand service broker that dynamically creates and scales Hazelcast clusters without pre-provisioning blocks of VMs

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

If you change `managementCenterConfig` in your JSON configuration file, then all VMs are shutdown at the same time. This means that you lose all the cluster data unless you are persisting that data elsewhere.
